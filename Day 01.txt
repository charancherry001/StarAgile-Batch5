Module 1 - Linux & Shell Scripting
-------------------------------------------------------
=> Why we need to learn Linux?

Windows	- It is developed by Microsoft
Linux	- It is developed by Linus Torvalds

Windows	- It is recommended for personal use
Linux	- It is for professional use

=> Linux Distributions
Hyderabad Biryani - Recipe - Hyderabad (Paradise, Bawarchi)
Bangalore - Hyderabadi Biryani

Linux OS --- Code --- Modified Code --- MyCode1, MyCode2, MyCode3
Ubuntu, Debian, Suse Linux, Cent OS....

In AWS cloud, most of these distributions are available as Amazon machine Image (AMI)
1. RPM based
	- RedHat
	- Cento OS
	- Amazon Linux 2
	- Amazon Linux 2023
2. Debian based
	- Suse
	- Ubuntu

In real-time, we will prefer to work either with Amazon Linux or Ubuntu OS.

=> How we can work with Linux OS?
AWS Cloud ---- EC2 ---- Launch a Virtual Machine / EC2 Instance

=> How to connect to a VM?
1. Within the cloud (EC2 instance connect, Sessions Manager...)
2. MobaXTerm, Putty, Gitbash...

Note: MobaXTerm is preferred throughout the modules

=> Launching a EC2 VM

In Linux we have 2 types of users;
1. ec2-user (default)
2. root

ec2-user Vs. root
ec2-user doesn't have all permissions to execute specific commands (Installation of a softwares)'
root user will have all kinds of privileges 

whoami
sudo su (or) sudo -i
exit

To know in which path you are currently there
pwd (Present Working Directory)

In Linux OS, everything is represented as "files"
.txt, .py, .java, .net.....

How to create files in Linux OS?
1. touch
2. cat
3. vi (or) vim

How to see the list of files available?
ls (or) ls -l (or) ll

create 5 files, but number should start from 95 and end at 100. 
.java
Netflix

touch netflix{95..100}.java

delete a file --- rm

How to work with vi command?
1. vi <FileName>
2. Goto the "insert" mode --- press "i"
3. Write the content
4. press "esc"
5. To save and quit --- :wq

history
date

In Linux we create directories
mkdir <DirectoryName>

In the beginning of a line, if you see -, then its a file
In the beginning of a line, if you see d, then its a directory

to go inside a directory
cd <DirectoryName> --- Change Directory

To delete everything ---- rm -rf *

this is a new line added by charan
